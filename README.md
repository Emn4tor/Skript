# Skript collection
Welcome to the Skript repository! This repository contains a collection of snippets, finished codes, and tutorials related to Skript.

## Requirements
To be able to use the scripts from this repo you need to install [**Skript**](https://github.com/SkriptLang)
To be able to use the full potential, it's recommended to use [**Paper**](https://papermc.io/). Paper is a high-performance Minecraft server software that is a fork of Spigot. While **Spigot** can also be used, it may not have all the features and optimizations that **Paper** provides. It's important to note that CraftBukkit *cannot* be used for Skript.
